# MyDL

## Repo Intro

This repo is to construct a DL library for learning and testing some classic projects that include:

  1, Multiple GAN(DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN and more) implementation in Tensorflow.
  
## File structure

      -- GAN
         "Generative Adversarial Networks"

      -- utils
         "some assistant files"

       
## Mini projects

The projects is listed here in a recommended reading sequence:

### 1. GAN.py
It implemented GANs in tensorflow to generate synthetic data.

### mnist_gan.py
It implemented GANs to generate MNIST dataset's synthetic data.

## How to use

    1, Download the repo to local, a star to the repo is appreciated.
    
    2, make sure Python3 is installled in your local env, a virtual env is recommended.
    
    3, pip3 install -r requirements
    
    4, feel free to run any project under root.

## More to do

I will upload the following extra models and projects in very recent time.

[] SVM

[] VAE(Generative model)

[] LSTM

[] XGBoost
